# Tactical Media Project for ARTF2223



This is a spoofed website on the MBTA, created to humorously highlight its unreliability and shortcomings in the transit system. Our aim is to provide a lighthearted take on the challenges faced by commuters, sparking conversation and raising awareness about the need for improvements. Please note that this website is not affiliated with the MBTA and is meant for entertainment purposes only.
